                <p>This tool is designed to help Infection control and prevention nurses, environmental services managers, and anyone involved in keeping a medical facility free of disease-causing pathogens choose the best surface disinfectant product for their specific needs.</p>
                <h3>How to use this tool:</h3>
                <p>If you are not familiar with medical facility surface disinfection, please take a moment to review the slides at right.</p>
                <p>Just click on the Continue button, and answer the four questions in the questionnaire. Know the Spaulding level of kill you need for your situation, and select the appropriate option in question 3. Because product cost is specific to your facility and purchasing organization, a cost calculator spreadsheet is available for download at the bottom of the results page.</p>
                <p>We hope this tool is useful for you in preventing the spread of disease in your facility.</p>

                            Surface disinfection is done several times per day in a medical facility, and yet is a difficult and complicated task to achieve. Learn these basic factors in product selection to make the task a little easier and more effective. </p>

                            <p class="carcopy copy2">Cleaning and Disinfection<br /><br />
                            Cleaning removes dirt and debris from surfaces, but doesn't kill any germs left behind. Disinfecting kills pathogens with chemicals. Make sure you are using an EPA-registered disinfectant, not just a cleaner.</p>

                          <div class="swiper-slide" style="background-image: url(https://s31.postimg.org/maxzim1yz/floor2.png)" height="600">
                            <p class="carcopy copy3">Factors That Affect Efficacy<br /><br />
                            Medical-grade disinfectants kill 99.9999% of pathogens on a surface, but only when the surface remains wet. If the label's kill time (the length of time required to kill the pathogens listed on the product label) is longer than the time it takes to dry, full disinfection has not been achieved. Test samples of new products to determine if they will stay wet long enough to meet their kill times. If you are using quat or bleach chemistry liquids with separate wipers, make sure the wiper fabric does not bind to the active ingredient, which diminishes efficacy.</p>

                            <p class="carcopy copy4">Other Important Factors to Consider<br /><br />
                            Check the human safety HMIS rating of your product to ensure it's safe for staff and patients. Contact the product manufacturer to make sure the chemistry will not damage your expensive equipment by requesting a material compatibility list. Test products, especially concentrates, for ease of use. Compare the full cost of using the product (not just the product's case price).</div>
