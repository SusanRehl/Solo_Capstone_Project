# Solo Capstone Project

##Two-week individual project of the student's choice. Developed Scope of Work for this project.


Subject: Disinfectant product selector for medical facilities. Technology used: Angular, postgreSQL, Node, Express, Bootstrap

This project was selected to fulfill a need I had at my last position. 
During my work marketing hospital disinfectants, I wished I had an app that impartially presents
all relevant features of a variety of disinfectant products, and compares them based on specific user needs. 
I saw a huge need for this application for medical staff to very quickly select appropriate products, in order to reduce the spread of disease, yet is not very accessible. 


Target users are medical facility infection control nurse managers and EVS (janitorial) managers. 
The application allows users to select options relevant to their disinfecting situation, 
and receive a ranked list of the best EPA-registered products for that situation based on factual product data. 
Additional features included educational information about disinfection, download list as a PDF, 
and a cost calculator. Data was sourced from the EPA’s PPLS API, and supplemented with additional data 
from manufacturers’ technical documents (EPA Master Label, Technical Document, and SDS) to create a comprehensive database.
