# soloproject
Disinfectant product selector for medical facilities. Technology used: Angular, postgreSQL, Node, Express, Bootstrap

Project was selected to fulfill a need I had at my last position. 
During my work marketing hospital disinfectants, I wished I had an app that impartially presents
all relevant features of a variety of disinfectant products, and compares them based on specific user needs. 
This information is vital for medical staff to select appropriate products, in order to reduce the spread of disease, 
yet is not very accessible. I hope to find a way to make this app available to those who need this information.
Target users are medical facility infection control nurse managers and EVS (janitorial) managers. 
The application allows users to select options relevant to their disinfecting situation, 
and receive a ranked list of the best EPA-registered products for that situation based on factual product data. 
Additional features included educational information about disinfection, download list as a PDF, 
and a cost calculator. Data was sourced from the EPA’s PPLS API, and supplemented with additional data 
from manufacturers’ technical documents (EPA Master Label, Technical Document, and SDS) to create a comprehensive database.
